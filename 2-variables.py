# Variables in Python

# A variable is like a container that stores data.
# You don't need to declare the type in Python â€” it detects automatically.

# String variable
name = "Sumaiya"

# Integer variable
age = 22

# Float variable
height = 5.4

# Boolean variable
is_student = True

# Print all variables
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height)
print("Is Student:", is_student)
