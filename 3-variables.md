# Variables in Python

A **variable** is like a container that stores a value.  
In Python, you don't need to specify the data type — it automatically understands the type based on the value you assign.

# Example Code

```python
# String variable
name = "Sumaiya"

# Integer variable
age = 22

# Float variable
height = 5.4

# Boolean variable
is_student = True

# Print all variables
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height)
print("Is Student:", is_student)

## Output
Name: Sumaiya
Age: 22
Height: 5.4
Is Student: True

## Explanation
-name is a string because it's inside quotes.
-age is an integer (whole number).
-height is a float (decimal number).
-is_student is a boolean — it stores either True or False.
